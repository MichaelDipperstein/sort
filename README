DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains a simple and readable ANSI C implementation of the
following sorting algorithms:
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort

My implementation is not intended to be the best or the fastest.  It is intended
to be a flexible, portable example of techniques used to sort items.  I
implemented these algorithms out of personal interest.

Each of the sort functions provided takes a speed hit for accepting generic data
types and a generic compare function.  Hard coding the data types and compare
function will speed up each function at the cost of flexibility.  I chose the
slower approach for two reasons:
1. The functions don't have to be rewritten for each type of data sorted.
2. Any intro to programming professor will quickly recognize that these
   functions are not the work of his/her students.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

Note: The Makefile assumes the use of gcc in a Linux or Windows environment.
Other environments may require customization.

USAGE
-----
Usage: sample <options>

Options:
  -n : number of elements to sort.
  -i : use insertion sort
  -b : use bubble sort
  -s : use shell sort
  -q : use quick sort
  -m : use merge sort
  -h : use heap sort
  -r : use radix sort
  -d : display sort results and other debug information
  -? : Print out command line options.

Default: sample -n1000

The sample code will generate an unsorted list of the specified number of
integer values, then sort the list using each of the algorithms specified.  If
debug is enabled, the unsorted list, the sorted lists, and number of comparisons
required to sort will be written to stdout.  Only the number of comparisons
required for the sort will be written if debug is disable.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
I have received a report that sorting large sets (>2^24 values) of 64-bit
integers frequently fails when attempted on PowerPC system running 64-bit Linux.
I have been unable to duplicate the problem on 32-bit x86 platforms and do not
have a 64-bit PowerPC platform to test on.

Another error may occur when the number of bytes being sorted exceeds the
capacity of size_t.
